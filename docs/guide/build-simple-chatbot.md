# Build an echo chatbot
This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through the process of building the same chatbot you played within the last guide. After completing this tutorial, you will be able to develop a [level 2](../essentials/5levels-cui.md#frame-with-slots) conversational experience, which is sufficient for allowing users to check your business hours or make a reservation. But let's start with a bit of background, as you will be using a new and more effective approach to build the chatbot.

## Background
A chatbot is an application with a conversational user interface (CUI). It is developed to provide user services, including answering informational questions and completing transactional tasks. A service is an interface for a business capability that usually consists of a set of Application Programming Interface (API) functions. These interfaces decouple the front end, like the chatbot, from the backend implementation of the service, so that they can be developed independently.

In order to invoke API functions in a conversational manner, the chatbot needs to create an instance of a function type through conversations, which implies that chatbot also needs to create instances for the input parameters of the function or attributes of composite types in a more general sense.

A type is considered conversationally exposed if the chatbot knows how to create an instance of it conversationally, potentially in multiple turns. This suggests a different approach to building chatbots: identify the API function types that you want to expose to users, and make these types, as well as all of their dependent types (both direct and indirect), conversationally exposed.

A type-based chatbot with multiple language support can then function in the following way: 
1. **Convert the user's utterance into an event**. Here, an event is a way of representing the meaning of a user's utterance in a language-independent way.
2. **Given the event and the current dialog state, generate a dialog act**. A dialog act is also a language-independent representation of meaning. It is generated by following interaction logic that greedily tries to complete the instantiation of the function type. Once a function object is created, the chatbot can invoke it and wrap the function return in a dialog act. 
3. **Render the dialog act back to the user in natural language**.

The same concept is also illustrated here.

#### A proper type system
OpenCUI is designed to support most APIs that can be defined by OpenAPI, which is a widely used standard for documenting RESTful APIs. This means that you can conversationally expose not only to primitive types like Int and String, but also to arrays and user-defined types with polymorphism support. This makes it easy to build conversational interfaces for arbitrary service APIs. In OpenCUI, functions are represented by skills, user-defined types are represented by frames, and primitive types are represented by entities.

Types declared in OpenCUI can be either internal or external. For internal types, OpenCUI generates a Kotlin class, while for external types, it uses existing Java/Kotlin types, ensuring that every type has a direct representation at the Java/Kotlin level. This allows users to tap into the vast Java ecosystem and leverage any available functionality, as well as use Kotlin code expressions to directly express logic.

#### Build chatbot in 3 layers
OpenCUI promotes a type-based approach to build conversational user interface, by introducing a set of dialog annotations that you can add to the type and its slots. For each composite type that you need to expose conversationally:
1. **Declare the type at the schema layer**. This includes the label of the type, the slots that are associated with the type, and the local functions and services that are available to the type.
2. **Add dialog annotations, and configure them in the interaction layer**. The interaction layer determines the language-independent aspects of the conversational interactions: whether the chatbot should ask the user to fill a slot, whether to provide a candidate list, and whether to confirm with the user when a value is received.
3. **For each language you want to support, configure annotations in required language layer**. The annotations in the language layer help dialog understanding module to map the text in the target language to structured semantics and back. For example, if you are creating a chatbot that supports English and Chinese, you will need to configure language layer annotations for both languages.

The primitive types, or entities, can be defined in only two layers: schema and language.

Clearly, a chatbot always consists of many types, and the order in which these types are defined matters. It is important to ensure that all the required types are defined before they are referenced, in order to avoid any circular dependencies or reference errors.

:::tip To reduce unnecessary complexity
Single-language chatbots are simpler to build than multi-language chatbots. This is because they do not have to deal with the complexities of Structural propagation. As a result, you do not need to know about different views (structure view, language view) or perform propagate operations when building a single-language chatbot. Instead, you only need to declare the type in order, specify annotations in each type, and then add language-related content.

This series of quickstart guides will use single-language chatbots as examples to show how to build chatbots. This will help to focus on the platform's usage logic, rather than the operational process, which is simpler and easier to understand.

For more information about multi-language chatbots, see [Multilingual](../reference/platform/multilingual.md).

## Before you start
- [Sign up](./signingup.md#sign-up) for an account and log in to [OpenCUI](https://build.opencui.io/login).
- [Clone a simple chatbot](clone-simple-chatbot.md) to get an idea of what to build.

## Create chatbot: pingpong
You can create a chatbot under any organization, following these steps:
1. Within an organization, in the upper right corner of the project area, click **Create** and select **Create chatbot**.
2. In the pop-up window, complete the form for chatbot basic settings and click **Create**. For this simple chatbot, you only need to fill in the following three fields:

   - **Project label**: The unique identifier for the chatbot. Type a short, memorable label for your chatbot. We suggest using a lowercase label. In this case, enter `pingpongSL` (The project label "pingpongSL" is used to distinguish single-language pingpong from multilingual chatbots. The "SL" stands for "single language.").

   - **Region**: Where you want to deploy this chatbot. Ideally, it should be close to your users. 

   - **Language**: The language your chatbot supports. In this case, select **English(en)**.

::: warning Caution: Project label and region are immutable.
Choose your project label and region carefully, because you cannot change them after creation. You can, however, clone and rename a project. When you do this, the connections and user session data for the project will not be cloned, for privacy reasons.

## Build types
Under type-based chatbot development, building a chatbot can be achieved by defining every type required by it in a "least dependencies first" approach. The conversational experience you will create in this guide requires a dependent entity type called `Location` and a skill called `PingPong`. 

### Build entity: Location
The most basic type in OpenCUI is "entity". It is a primitive type that the chatbot knows how to extract the value of from the user's utterance. OpenCUI provides many predefined entities, such as `java.time.LocalDate` for dates, `io.opencui.core.Email` for email addresses, and so on. You cannot change these predefined entities. OpenCUI also allows you to create custom entities. A custom entity instance contains a single reference label and a list of expressions based on the user mentions in their utterance. For better understanding, it is helpful to enumerate common expressions for each instance.

In this case, let's build a custom entity type `Location` as follows:

#### Create entity: Location
1. Inside the `pingpongSL` chatbot and **Types** page, click **Create** on the right side, select **Create entity**.
2. Enter the label `Location` and press enter.
:::info Create entity type: Location
![create entity](/images/guide/pingpong/create_entity.png)
:::

#### Add entity instances
1. Inside the `Location` entity and **Instances** tab, click **Add**.
2. In the pop-up window, 
   - Enter the **Label**, for example `seattle` or `paloAlto`.
   - Enter the **Expressions**, for example `Seattle` for `seattle`, or `Palo Alto` for `paloAlto`, and **Save**.
3. Repeat the same steps to add more.

#### Add names
Every type in OpenCUI should have a name. The name is used for both detecting mentions of this type from the user's utterance and displaying the use of this type to the user.

To add names for `Location`, switch to **Expression** tab, in the **Names** section, enter `Location` and press enter.

![PingPong add entity expression](/images/guide/pingpong/pingpong_entity_expression.png)

### Build skill: PingPong
Conceptually, a skill is a function exposed in a conversational manner, with input parameters represented by its slots. In this tutorial, you will construct a basic skill called `PingPong` that has a single slot of type `Location`. Once an instance of this function type is created, the chatbot will respond with an acknowledgment in the form of `pong to ${location}`.

#### Create skill: PingPong
1. Inside the `pingpong` chatbot and **Types** page, click **Create** on the right side, and select **Create skill**.
2. Enter the label `PingPong` and press enter.
   ::: tip Need to know
   In OpenCUI, a label is an identifier that is independent of the language used. The skill label, being a type of label, should follow these guidelines:
   - It should start with a capital letter.
   - It should be between 2 and 100 characters long.
   - It should only contain letters, digits, and underscores.

   ![intent label](/images/guide/pingpong/intent_label.png)

#### Add slot: location
1. Inside the `PingPong` skill and **Schema** tab, in the **Slots** section, select the type you want to add as slot. In this case, select **Entity > Location**.

   ![add slot](/images/guide/pingpong/add_slot.png)

2. Pick a label for the slot. The label is a unique identifier for the slot. It will be used to reference the slot in other places, such as in the Response. In this case, use `location`.

#### Annotate slot: location
If the user does not provide all the information that the chatbot needs in the initial utterance, the chatbot can prompt the user for that information. To do this, you need to select the **Always ask** fill strategy for the slot. This will make the **Prompt** field required, and you will need to add at least one template to it.

To annotate a slot, inside the `PingPong/location` slot and **Annotation** tab:
1. Select **Always ask** in the **Fill strategy** section. 

   ![define fill strategy](/images/guide/pingpong/always_ask.png)

2. Fill templates for Prompt. Enter the sentences in **Prompts** section. For example, `Wow. Where is the "ping" coming from?`.

   ![add prompt](/images/guide/pingpong/add_prompt.png)

3. Add names for `location` slot. Under the **Expression** tab, enter the names in **Names** section, such as `location`.

   ![add slot name](/images/guide/pingpong/add_name.png)

#### Annotate skill: PingPong
For this simple skill, only two type level annotations: names, utterance exemplars, are required. If a user's utterance is semantically similar to any of the exemplars entered here, it will be considered as an intention to trigger this skill. OpenCUI dialog understanding (DU) module are large language model based, so you do not need to enumerate all possible different utterances that can imply this skill. You just need to add some representative one, or the ones that was understood wrong so that DU can hot fix it.

To annotate skill `PingPong`, inside the `PingPong` skill and the **Expression** tab:
1. Add expression for `PingPong` skill. In the **Expressions** section, enter `ping` and press enter.
2. Add names for `PingPong` skill. In the **Names** section, enter `Ping Pong` for the PingPong skill display name and press enter.

![PingPong expression](/images/guide/pingpong/pingpong_expression.png)

#### Configure response
After being triggered, the PingPong skill responds a *"pong"* based on the location provided by the user, this behavior is controlled by a response. Responses are executed after the chatbot has all the slots filled per interaction logic defined by attached dialog annotations. In reality, chatbot should call out the service APIs and render the return back to user in natural text. It is often necessary to reference slots and function values in the response. In OpenCUI, this can be easily achieved using `${}` with arbitrary Kotlin code expression inside.

To configure response, inside the `PingPong` skill and the **Response** tab:
1. Select **Single value message** under the **Default action** section to declare a simple reply.

   ![add response](/images/guide/pingpong/add_response.png)

2. Enter the reply `Great! Pong to ${location?.expression()}.` in the **Single value message** field and press enter.

   ![PingPong simple reply](/images/guide/pingpong/pingpong_simple_reply.png)

::: tip
To render a slot value in a language dependent fashion, use `${location?.expression()}` instead of `${location}` which will be rendered to a language independent label.
