# Build a simple chatbot
This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through the process of building the same chatbot you played in last guide. After completing this tutorial, you will be able to develop [level 2](../essentials/5levels-cui.md#frame-with-slots) conversational experience, which is enough to allow users to check your business hours or make a reservation. But let's start with a bit of background, since you are not building chatbot in your typical flow-based approach.

### Background
A chatbot is an application with a conversational user interface (CUI). It is developed to provide user services, including answering informational questions and completing transactional tasks. A service is an interface for a business capability that usually consists of a set of Application Programming Interface (API) functions. These interfaces decouple the front end, like the chatbot, from the backend implementation of the service, so that they can be developed independently.

In order to invoke API functions in a conversational manner, the chatbot needs to create an instance of a function type through conversations, which implies that chatbot also needs to create instances for the input parameters of the function or attributes of composite types in a more general sense. 


A type is conversationally exposed if chatbot knows how to create an instance of it conversationally, potentially in multiple turns. This suggests a different way of building chatbots: start by identifying the API function types that you want to expose to users. Then, make all of their dependent types, both direct and indirect, conversationally exposed. 

A type-based chatbot with multiple language support can then function in the following way: 
1. **Convert the user's utterance into an event;** An event is a way of representing the meaning of a user's utterance in a language-independent way.
2. **Given the event and the current dialog state, generate a dialog act;** A dialog act is also a language-independent representation of meaning. It is generated by following interaction logic that greedily tries to complete the instantiation of the function type. Once a function object is created, the chatbot can invoke it and wrap the function return in a dialog act. 
3. **Render the dialog act back to the user in natural language.**

The same concept is also illustrated here.

#### A proper type system
OpenCUI is designed to support most APIs that can be defined by OpenAPI, a widely used standard for documenting RESTful APIs. This means you can add dialog annotation to not only primitive types like Int and String, but also array and user defined type with polymorphism support. This makes it easy to build conversational interfaces for arbitrary service APIs. In OpenCUI, functions are represented by skills, user-defined types by frames, and primitive type by entities. 

Types declared in OpenCUI can be either internal or external. For internal types, OpenCUI generates a Kotlin class, while for external types, it uses existing Java/Kotlin types, ensuring that every type has a direct representation at the Java/Kotlin level. This allows users to tap into the vast Java ecosystem and leverage any available functionality, as well as use Kotlin code expressions to directly express logic.


#### Build chatbot in 3 layers
OpenCUI promotes a type-based approach to build conversational user interface, by introducing a set of dialog annotations that you can add to the type and its slots. For each composite type that you need to expose conversationally:
1. **Declare the type at the schema layer**. This includes the label of the type, the slots that are associated with the type, and the local functions and services that are available to the type.
2. **Add dialog annotations, and configure them in the interaction layer**. The interaction layer determines the language-independent aspects of the conversational interactions: whether the chatbot should ask the user to fill a slot, whether to provide a candidate list, and whether to confirm with the user when a value is received.
3. **For each language you want to support, configure annotations in required language layer**. The annotations in the language layer help dialog understanding module to map the text in the target language to structured semantics and back. For example, if you are creating a chatbot that supports English and Chinese, you will need to configure language layer annotations for both languages.

The primitive types, or entities, can be defined in only two layers: schema and language.

Clearly, a chatbot always consists of many types, and the order in which these types are defined matters. It is important to ensure that all the required types are defined before they are referenced, in order to avoid any circular dependencies or reference errors.

##### Annotate a composite type
It is common for composite types to have slots, and then you have to decide whether you want to follow a layer-first or slot-first approach to annotate such types. In this series of quickstart guides, annotation will be added in a slot-first, or one-slot-at-a-time approach, making it easy for you to follow:
1. Repeat the following steps for each slot:
   1. Add all annotations needed for that slot, and configure them in the interaction layer.
   2. Configure annotations in the language layer for this slot.
2. Add the type level annotation, in both layers.
3. If the type is a skill, configure the response for it, in both layers.

This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through the process of building the same chatbot you played in last guide. After completing this tutorial, you will be able to develop [level 2](../essentials/5levels-cui.md#frame-with-slots) conversational experience, enough to allow users to check your business hours or make a reservation.


## Before you start
- [Sign up](./signingup.md#sign-up) for an account and log in to [OpenCUI](https://build.opencui.io/login).
- It is helpful to get familiar with [the type-based way of building chatbot](../essentials/README.md).
- We assume that you have finished [clone a simple chatbot](clone-simple-chatbot.md), so you get a better understanding of what to build.

## Create a project
You can create a chatbot under any organization, following these steps:
1. Within an organization, in the upper right corner of the project area, click **Create** and select **Create chatbot**.
2. In the pop-up window, complete the form for chatbot basic settings. For this simple chatbot, you only need to fill in the following three fields:
   - **Project label**: the unique identifier for the chatbot. Type a short, memorable label for your chatbot. We suggest using a lowercase label. For example, "*pingpong*".
   - **Region**: where you want to deploy this chatbot. Ideally, it should be close to your users. 
   - **Languages**: the languages your chatbot supports, you can add multiple languages. Multilingual chatbots assume you deliver the same service to each user in their native languages.
3. Click **Create**.

::: warning Caution: Project label and region are immutable.
Choose your project label and region carefully, because you cannot change them after creation. You can, however, clone and rename a project. When you do this, the connections and user session data for the project will not be cloned, for privacy reasons.

## Build types
Under type-based chatbot development, building a chatbot can be achieved by defining every type required by it in a "least dependencies first" approach. The conversational experience you will create in this guide requires a skill called 'PingPong' and a entity called 'Location'.

### Build entity: Location
The most basic type in OpenCUI is 'entity'. It is a primitive type that the chatbot knows how to extract the value of from the user's utterance. OpenCUI provides many predefined entities, such as `java.time.LocalDate` for dates, `io.opencui.core.Email` for email addresses, and so on. In this case, let's build a custom entity type `Location` in schema layer and language layer as follows.

#### Schema Layer: create entity type and add instances
Ensure that you are inside the **PingPong** chatbot and under the **Structure** view:
1. Click **Create** button on the right side, and select **Create entity** to create a new entity.
2. Enter a label for the entity type and press enter. For example, `location`.
3. Within the `Location` entity, click **Add** button to add entity instances, you are required to provide a language independent label for each instance, such as `seattle` in the label field and **Save**. You can add as many instances as you need. No spaces are allowed in the instance label, or in any label at all.

:::

#### Language layer: add annotations
To enable the chatbot to extract user mentions and create instances for an entity type from user utterances, user-defined entities come with a list-based recognizer, which requires the builder to [enumerate common expressions](../reference/annotations/templateandexemplar.md#expression-for-entity-instance) for each instance that was added for this entity type in the previous step.

::: tip Remember to propagate the change you made under the **Structure** view
- Both schema layer and interaction layer are defined under **Structure** view, but language layer is under corresponding language view, for example, for English, it should be under "Language/en".
- Before beginning work on the language layer, always [propagate](./opencui-flow.md#propagate-the-changes-to-language-layer) the changes made so far to the language layer, and then switch over to the corresponding language view.
::: 

##### Expressions for instance
For each instance, you need to enumerate the common expressions that might refer to the instance.
1. Navigate to the entity and head to the **Instances** tab. 
2. For each instance, click to add **Expressions** in the pop-up window.
3. Click **Save**.

##### Names for entity type
For type itself, you should also provide the expression in form of name for the given language.
1. Within the `Location` entity, head to the **Expression** tab.
2. In the **Names** section, enter `Location` for the Location entity display name and press enter. This field also provides examples of how this type is mentioned in different languages.

### Build skill: PingPong
Conceptually, a skill is a function exposed in a conversational manner, with input parameters represented by its slots. In this tutorial, you will construct a basic skill called "PingPong" that has a single slot of type 'Location'. Once an instance of this function type is created, the chatbot will respond with an acknowledgment in the form of `pong to ${location}`.

#### Schema layer: declare a skill
At this layer, you will create the skill and add all its slots that represent input parameters for the corresponding function. Although not necessary for this particular simple skill, this layer is also where you can declare any required local functions and services, and implement these native local functions as well.

##### Create the skill
Inside the **PingPong** chatbot, head to **Types** page and make sure you are under the **Structure** view.
1. Click **Create** button on the right side, and select **Create skill** to create a new skill.
2. Enter a label for the skill and press enter. For example, `PingPong`.
   ::: tip Need to know
   In OpenCUI, a label is not a name but an identifier that is independent of the language used. The Skill Label, being a type of label, should adhere to the following guidelines:
   - It should start with a capital letter.
   - It should be between 2 and 100 characters in length.
   - It should only contain letters, digits, and underscores.

##### Add slots
On a composite type's **Schema** tab you can add slots to this skill.
To add a slot to a type:
1. Inside the `PingPong` skill, ensure that you are under the **Structure** view.
2. Under the **Schema** tab, select the type you want to add as slot in the **Slots** section. In this case, select entity type `Location`.
3. Pick a label for the slot, in this case let's use `location`, so that you can reference it in the response.

####  Annotate type: PingPong
Let's annotate `PingPong` skill per procedure defined in [here](#annotate-a-composite-type). This guide will only show you how to configure only for English, but configuring for other languages should be identical.  


##### Add slot level annotation: location
In case the user did not tell chatbot which location is he from in the initial utterance, the chatbot needs to prompt the user for that information. The exact prompt behavior is controlled by configuring the [fill strategy](../reference/annotations/fillstrategy.md) for that slot. This needs to be done in both interaction layer and language layer.

###### Interaction layer
Inside the `PingPong` skill, ensure that you are under the **Structure** view.
1. Within the `location` slot of `PingPong` skill, navigate to **Annotation** tab and select **Always ask** in the **Fill strategy** section.
  
   ::: thumbnail
   ![define fill strategy](/images/guide/pingpong/always_ask.png)
   :::

###### Language layer
Within the `location` slot of `PingPong` skill, ensure that you are under the **Language/en** view.
1. Fill templates for Prompt. When fill strategy of slot is always ask, you must add at least one template to Prompt. 
   - Head to the **Annotation** tab.
   - Enter the sentences in **Prompts** section. For example, "*Wow. Where is the "ping" coming from?*".

   :::
2. Add names for `location` slot. 
   - Head to the **Expression** tab.
   - Enter the names in **Names** section, such as "Location".
   ::: thumbnail
   ![add prompt](/images/guide/pingpong/add_name.png)

##### Add type level annotation
For this simple skill, only one type level annotation: utterance exemplars, is required. Utterance only needs to be configured at language layer.

###### Language layer
Navigate to the `PingPong` skill and head to the **Expression** tab under the **Language/en** view..
- In the **Names** section, enter `Ping Pong` for the PingPong skill display name and press enter. This field also provides examples of how this type is mentioned in different languages.
- In the **Expressions** section, enter `ping` and press enter. If a user's utterance matches any of the exemplars entered here, it will be considered as an intention to trigger this skill.

:::

##### Configure response
After being triggered, the PingPong skill responds a *"pong"* based on the location provided by the user, this behavior is controlled by a response. Responses are executed after the chatbot has all the slots filled per interaction logic defined by attached dialog annotations. In reality, chatbot should call out the service APIs and render the return back to user in natural text. It is often necessary to reference slots and function values in the response, this can be easily done using `${}` on OpenCUI.

###### Interaction layer
Inside the `PingPong` skill, ensure that you are under the **Structure** view.
1. Navigate to the **Response** tab and select **Single value message** under the **Default action** section to declare a simple reply.

###### Language layer
Propagate and switch to the **Language/en** view.
1. Under to the **Responses** tab, enter `Great! Pong to ${location?.expression()}.` in the **Single value message** field and press enter.

## Test a chatbot
Before you begin testing your newly defined chatbot using the **Debug** tool, click **Commit** in the upper-right corner to commit your changes in the language layer. Note that Debug can only be used to test committed content for current language, per [OpenCUI workflow](opencui-flow.md#commit-the-changes).
