# Signup and Login

The Framely platform provides you with an effective way to build CUI for your services. To do this we require the following:

- A Github acccount
- Registration to the Framely platform

The singup and login can be done in the following steps:

1. Get a github account in using steps provided [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)(skip this if you already have one.)

2. Fill in [this registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYGRXfYnB_uDKTS4hUfcD3w1f9LDI9swcC5Qhy71PTS_JANA/viewform). During this private beta phase, this provides us with initial information to help us help you in setting up your free trial.

3. Wait for the email notification that your account is ready. It might take a short waiting period while we get the gears running for you.

3. Once notified, we can login with the click of a button.

At this point, you should be greeted with a page similar to this:

That is it.
