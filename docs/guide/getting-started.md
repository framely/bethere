# Get Started
Although one can use Framely to serve user's informational need, we designed Framely to help 
you to provide transactional service conversationally as well, so that your conversational services can potentially become a revenue center instead of a cost center for you business, and you can follow simple industrial standard three steps to get there. 

## Build
To provide transactional services via chatbot, it is natural to think chatbot as conversational user interface for your services. 

### Service as Schema

### Interaction as Annotation

### Language Template and Exemplar

## Test


## Deploy

### Hosted

### Self Deployed


It consists of two parts: Framely platform is a web interface whether conversational component is declaratively defined and composed into bigger and bigger conversational experience definition. These definitions are then generated into kotlin code, and together with Framely runtime, the generated chatbot can be deployed anywhere builder wants. 
Chatbots, the application with conversational user interface, are developed to deliver good user experiences. But, delivering good user experience alone can not justify the effort for business. For example, as a coffee shop owner, you may not like to hear this conversation between your barista bot and your customer:

::: story
User: *I like some iced coffee.*

Barista: *Sorry, we ran out , the Starbucks next dapoor has some excellent choice.*
:::


Two things jump out from this short exchange between user and service agent. First, we have to teach or program our service chatbot our business rules so that it helps our cause. Second, this teaching or programming need to be efficient so that we can react quickly to ever-changing business conditions. 


So what happens if your customer asks your barista bot for a haircut? It can simply say "I am only trained to help you with your coffee needs. What do you want to drink today?" Nobody will fault your service bot here.

When our customers' step out of our service boundary, bot can safely play ignorance without resulting in loss of user experience. This allows us to focus on a much simpler problem of modeling conversation around limited services we offer, instead of all possible conversations. From a business perspective, this means we do not really have to wait for conversational AI. Instead, all we need is some conversational UI that can be easily programmed to do the following things:


Identify customers' intent, understand their preferences (in terms of the slots) efficiently. 
Offer suggestions when users are stuck, and provide value recommendations so that they can zero in on their choice quickly. 
If users move out of scope, remind them of the boundary, bring the conversation back.
