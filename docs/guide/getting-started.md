# From Beginner to Master
OpenCUI is designed to enable existing business development teams to build natural conversational user interfaces (CUIs) for their services in a cost-effective fashion. It is a component-based CUI framework, so you don't have to start from scratch. Each component can be built declaratively in three layers, allowing different aspects to be handled by different people. Additionally, it features a language perception layer based on large language models (LLMs) that can operate using only a few examples. This allows builders to focus on creating unique experiences, rather than being bogged down by the necessary technical complexities.

The OpenCUI platform can be useful at various stages of chatbot development, such as development, testing, and deployment. However, its primary focus is to assist builders during the development phase. Once services is ready, the conversational user interface for those services can be constructed declaratively using the [OpenCUI platform](https://build.opencui.io). 

While we build OpenCUI based on many best practices in building user interface applications, to deal with the unique challenges presented in building CUI, such as user can say anything at any time, we need to introduce some unique solutions. The conceptual model that is needed for one to take full advantage of OpenCUI, thus need a bit of practice to get used to. To assist you in this, we have developed a series of tutorials that aim to guide you step-by-step in understanding the conceptual model and becoming proficient in using OpenCUI to build exceptional conversational experiences.
