# Schema Grounded Conversational User Interface
Chatbots, the application with conversational user interface, are developed to deliver services with good user experiences. However, good user experience alone may not be the only motivation for business to develop one. For example, take a look at this conversation between your barista bot and your customer:

::: story
User: *I like some iced coffee.*

Barista: *Sorry, we ran out, but the Starbucks next door has some excellent choices.*
:::

It is good user experience alright, but as a coffee shop owner, you might not want to spend money on this chatbot. To invest your precious resource to build conversation experiences, couple things had to happen. First, you can program your service chatbot with your business rules so that it helps to reach your business goal. Second, this programming needs to be efficient so that you can adapt quickly to ever-changing business conditions, and of course you have to do this at a cost that does not overweight the benefit.



So what happens if your customer asks your barista bot for a haircut? It can simply say "I am only trained to help you with your coffee needs. What do you want to drink today?" Nobody will fault your service bot here. 



When our customers' step out of our service boundary, bot can safely play ignorance without resulting in loss of user experience. This allows us to focus on a much simpler problem of modeling conversation around limited services we offer, instead of all possible conversations. From a business perspective, this means we do not really have to wait for conversational AI. Instead, all we need is some conversational UI that can be easily programmed to do the following things:

Identify customers' intent, understand their preferences (in terms of the slots) efficiently. 
Offer suggestions when users are stuck, and provide value recommendations so that they can zero in on their choice quickly. 
If users move out of scope, remind them of the boundary, bring the conversation back.
