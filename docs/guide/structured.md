# Cooperative Principle

To build conversational user interface (CUI) for your service, we focus on goal oriented conversations where participants are assumed to have a common goal. In business world, this typically mean both sides want to complete service transaction, or businesses deliver service user wants. The cooperative principle says that parties involved normally attempt to be informative, truthful, relevant, and clear. The concept was introduced by philosopher H. Paul Grice in his 1975 article "Logic and Conversation" in which he argued that "talk exchanges" were not merely a "succession of disconnected remarks," and would not be rational if they were. Grice suggested instead that meaningful dialogue is characterized by cooperation. "Each participant recognizes in them, to some extent, a common purpose or set of purposes, or at least a mutually accepted direction."

## Four Pillars 
Grice expanded his cooperative principle with the four following conversational maxims, which he believed anyone wishing to engage in meaningful, cogent conversation must follow.

### Maxim of Quantity
Say no less than the conversation requires. Say no more than the conversation requires. The maxim of quantity means that we provide as much information as needed to achieve a goal, no more and no less. Think of the difference between having a conversation with someone who replies in just Yes or No statements and another one with someone who goes on a long monologue with unnecessary detail. This is a critical principle that chatbots must follow in order to continue the conversation with a user and keep them engaged. 

### Maxim of Quality
Don't say what you believe to be false. Don't say things for which you lack evidence. The maxim of quality refers to provide information that is true. Being truthful in a conversation means avoiding falsehoods and saying things without adequate evidence. 

### Maxim of Manner
Don't be obscure. Don't be ambiguous. Be brief. Be orderly. When designing conversations, it is also important to follow the maxim of manner. This means being clear, brief and orderly while avoiding obscurity or ambiguity.  

### Maxim of Relevance
Be relevant. The maxim of relevance suggests that we engage in conversations that are relevant to others. For chatbots, this would mean replying to queries with information that help the user with their goal. A response that is not relevant to the user can break the natural flow of conversation and turn the user away.  


## Max Min principle
By designing bot to help the cooperative user only, one will already avoid the unnecessary over design, thus greatly reduce the complexity and cost of building the effective chatbots. We take one step further by explicitly seek simultaneously maximizing user experience and minimizing building cost. This means that user should be able to say whatever they want to say, but the bot should behave as simple as possible, so it is easy to build, as long as it is still effective in helping user.

Unlike GUI application where we have full control of how user can interact with us, for chatbot, we can not control what user want to say and when they say it. This is actually good for user as they do not have to learn anything and still be able to get what they want. So the good conversational user interface design should anticipate any things, so bots always have something reasonable to say. 

However, this does not mean the bot we build need to serve any request user might have. Building such an omnipotent bot does not make business sense. Since the goal is to deliver any services in a cost-effective fashion, we can design bot to follow a simple yet effective strategy, so it is easy for builder to design and debug. In particular, at any given time, bot will only engage in single conversation sequence with one goal, and it will try to bring the active conversation sequence to closure before it move onto a different one. When user digress in the middle of transaction service, bot will react to that and then bring conversation back on track. We say that bot engages in structured conversations.


## Structured Conversations
Structured conversations are simply composite conversation sequences, in both sequential and nested sense. Each sequence has concrete goal, and have a clear start and finish. Finish can come in different flavors: including abort by user or early exit per business logic. Furthermore, each sequence has a clear owner. Owner start the sequence, and set the goal and communicate to other party, and  other party is cooperating in help to achieve the goal for the owner. 

Current conversation owner can yield ownership to other party: for example, the bot can say "what can I do for you", this can potentially start a nested conversation sequence that is owned by user. And after the sequence concludes, then the ownership automatically get back to bot. Of course, in this case, user can choose not to take the ownership by simply reply "nothing, thanks" , which will bring closure to bots' owned sequence, bot is expected to simply close the sequence in the next turn. 

Structured conversations can be carried out using multiple stacks, each for one topic. Stack is a natural tool for nested structure.
