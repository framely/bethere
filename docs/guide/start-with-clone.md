# Clone a chatbot

OpenCUI is a platform designed to assist regular development teams in building natural conversational user interfaces (CUIs) for their services. To reduce the cost of building CUIs, OpenCUI adopts a type-based approach, so you can use pre-built components instead of building everything from scratch. There are two ways of reusing existing work on the OpenCUI platform: importing or cloning. This guide will show you how to begin experimenting with a chatbot by cloning.

The OpenCUI platform can be thought of as a GitHub specifically for chatbots. However, instead of repositories, the work within the organization is organized into projects, including chatbots, reusable modules, and providers:

- **Chatbot**: A CUI application where users can access a service through text-based or voice-based user interface.
- **Module**: A module consists of CUI components that handle interaction for a predefined domain. Modules can be reused by chatbots or other modules. You can define a service interface in a module that can be used by the module to interact with the backend.
- **Provider**: The provider is the stub to the implementation of the module interface.

When you clone a project, you create an exact copy in your organization that you can inspect and modify. Cloning a project allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Cloning an existing bot that provides similar services is a great way to get started since you don't have to start from scratch. This guide will show you how to clone a simple chatbot.

## Before you start

[Sign up](./signingup.md#sign-up) for an account and log in to [OpenCUI](https://build.opencui.io/login).

## Clone chatbot pingpong
In OpenCUI, you can discover a growing number of public projects by clicking on the **Explore** tab at the top of the page, which were built by the OpenCUI community. You can inspect a project to see if it fits your needs. Once you are inside the project you want to clone, you can follow the steps below to clone it.

In this guide, we will show you how to clone a chatbot (project for that matter) using pingpong as example. Click [here](https://build.opencui.io/org/me.quickstart/agent/pingpong/struct/intent?page=0&imported=false&search=) to go inside `me.quickstart.pingpong` chatbotï¼š

2. Once you click **Clone**, a pop-up window for basic chatbot settings will appear, you need to decide couple things: 
   - Choose which **Owner** organization you want to clone this project to.
   - Optionally you can change the **Project label** for this clone.
   - Decide on how you want to **Deploy** this, have OpenCUI hosting it for you or have it deployed on premise.
   - Pick which **Region** you want to deploy this chatbot to, pick one that is closer to your targeted users.
   - Click on **Clone** at the bottom of the popup.

::: warning Need To Know
A project's label or region can not be changed after creation or clone, so choose it wisely. For privacy reasons, the connections and user session data will NOT be cloned.
