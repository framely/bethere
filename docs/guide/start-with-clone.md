# Clone a chatbot

OpenCUI is a platform designed to help regular development teams build natural conversational user interfaces (CUIs) for their services. To reduce the cost of building CUIs, OpenCUI adopts a component-based approach so that you can use pre-built components instead of building everything from scratch. There are two different ways of reusing existing work on the OpenCUI platform: importing or cloning. This guide will show you how to begin experimenting with a chatbot by cloning it.

The OpenCUI platform can be thought of as a GitHub specifically for chatbots. However, instead of repositories, the work within the organization is organized into projects, including chatbots, reusable modules, and providers:

- **Chatbot**: A CUI application where users can access a service through text or voice instead of a graphical user interface.
- **Module**: A module consists of CUI components that handle interaction for a predefined domain. Modules can be reused by chatbots or other modules. You can define a service interface in a module that can be used by the module to interact with the backend.
- **Provider**: The provider is the implementation of the module interface.

When you clone a project, you create an exact copy in your organization that you can inspect and modify. Cloning a project allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Cloning an existing bot that provides similar services is a great way to get started since you don't have to start from scratch. This guide will show you how to clone a simple chatbot.
