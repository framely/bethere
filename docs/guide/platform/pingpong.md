This guide will walk you through using Framely console to build and test a simple PingPong chatbot. When interacting with this chatbot, you can get greeting message, and responce with *"pong"* to message *"ping"*, for example :

:::: conversation
::: bot Bot
Hi! I'm a virtual PingPong chatbot. How can I assist you today?
:::
::: user User
Ping
:::
::: bot Bot
Pong. What else can I do for you? 
:::
::: user User

After this simple PingPong chatbot, you can easily reach the first level of [the five levels of CUI](../5levels-cui.md), and manage how the messages are presented to users according to your own business. For example, if you are a restaurant, you can provide the experience of checking business hours for the user by modifying responses:

:::: conversation
::: bot Bot
Hi! I'm a virtual Restaurant chatbot. How can I assist you today?
:::
::: user User
What is your hours?
:::
::: bot Bot
We open every day from 10:00am to 9:00pm. Can I help you with anything else? 
:::
::: user User
No, thanks
:::
::: bot Bot
Thank you for contacting the virtual Restaurant chatbot. I am glad I could help you today. Good-bye!
