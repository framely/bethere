# From Beginner to Master
OpenCUI is designed to enable existing business development teams to build natural conversational user interfaces (CUIs) for their services in a cost-effective fashion. It is a component-based CUI framework, so you don't have to start from scratch. Each component can be built declaratively in three layers, allowing different aspects to be handled by different people. Additionally, it features a language perception layer based on large language models (LLMs) that can operate using only a few examples. This allows builders to focus on creating unique experiences, rather than being bogged down by the necessary technical complexities.

The OpenCUI platform can be useful at various stages of chatbot development, such as development, testing, and deployment. However, its primary focus is to assist builders during the development phase. Once services is ready, the conversational user interface for those services can be constructed declaratively using the [OpenCUI platform](https://build.opencui.io). 

While we build OpenCUI based on many best practices in building user interface applications, to deal with the unique challenges presented in building CUI, such as user can say anything at any time, we need to introduce some unique solutions. The conceptual model that is needed for one to take full advantage of OpenCUI, thus need a bit of practice to get used to. To assist you in this, we have developed a series of tutorials that aim to guide you step-by-step in understanding the conceptual model and becoming proficient in using OpenCUI to build exceptional conversational experiences. 

#### [Before you start](are-you-ready.md)
If you are serious about use OpenCUI in production, you might want to make sure you are prepared.

#### [Sign up](signingup.md)
Before we fully open up, we required you signup first so that we can get some idea on how we can help you. All you need is a GitHub account, ideally with your email verified. 

#### [Clone a chatbot](start-with-clone.md)
Cloning an existing project is the fastest way to start play with it. This guide show you how to clone a project, so that you do not have to start from scratch.

#### [Test a chatbot](debug.md)
Before you deploy your bot to production environment, you can test its behavior using the builtin **Debug** tool.

#### [Build a simple chatbot](pingpong.md)
This guide walks you through how to create a basic chatbot on the OpenCUI platform. The sample provides a quick way to explore the functionality of a chatbot, and it can serve as a starting point for your chatbot development. 

#### [Deploy a chatbot](quickstart-channel.md)
This guide walks you through how to use the builtin version control system to review and merge your change to master. It explains to you how chatbot work with messaging platform like Messenger, and shows you how to configure both side using Messenger as example. After going through this, you should be able to interact with your chatbot in Messenger. 

#### [Import a module](quickstart-reservation.md)
Reusable module can greatly reduce the cost of building chatbot. In this guide, we show you how to import a table reservation module, configure the provider so that you can start to provide table reservation through conversational user interface in no time.
