# From Beginner to Master
OpenCUI is a platform that helps you build conversational user interface for your services. It assumes that your services are defined and implemented separately. Once you declare your services on the [platform](https://build.opencui.io), you can build the conversational user interface for them declaratively.

To get the most out of OpenCUI, it is important to understand its type-based conceptual model. This is a significant departure from the more popular flow-based approach. We have created a set of tutorials that will walk you through the steps of understanding the conceptual model and becoming proficient in using OpenCUI to create outstanding conversational experiences.

#### [Sign up](signingup.md)
We're still in beta, so we need you to sign up before you can use our service. This will help us allocate resources and make sure you have the best possible experience. All you need is a GitHub account, and it's best if your email is verified.

#### [Clone a simple chatbot](clone-simple-chatbot.md)
Here's a quick way to get started: clone an existing project. This guide will walk you through the steps of cloning a simple chatbot and testing its behavior using the built-in debug tool.

#### [Build a simple chatbot](build-simple-chatbot.md)
This guide will walk you through the process of creating the simple chatbot that was introduced in the previous guide.

#### [Reuse a full-stack component](reuse-component.md)
Importing a module is another way to reuse existing work on OpenCUI. Modules are reusable conversational components based on their service interface. A full stack component is a module paired with a compatible provider. This guide will show you how to add functionality to your chatbot by reusing a full-stack component.

#### [Build a full-stack component](build-component.md)
This guide will show you how to develop the module and provider that were introduced in the previous guide.

#### [Deploy a chatbot](deploy-to-channel.md)
Using Messenger as an example, this guide will show you how to configure chatbot and channel so that they point to each other. Once you have completed these steps, your chatbot will be available in Messenger.

#### [OpenCUI workflow](opencui-flow.md)
