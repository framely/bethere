# From Beginner to Master
The OpenCUI platform is designed to help you build conversational user interface for your service, and we assume that the service is defined and implemented separately. Once the service is declared on [the platform](https://build.opencui.io), you can build the conversational user interface for those services declaratively.

To fully utilize OpenCUI, one needs to understand its type-based conceptual model, which is a sharp deviation from the popular flow-based approach. We have created a set of tutorials that will guide you through the steps of understanding the conceptual model and becoming skilled in utilizing OpenCUI to create outstanding conversational experiences.

#### [Sign up](signingup.md)
Before we fully open up, we required you signup first so that we can get some idea on how we can help you. All you need is a GitHub account, ideally with your email verified. 

#### [Clone a simple chatbot](start-with-clone.md)
Cloning an existing project is the fastest way to start play with it. This guide show you how to clone a simple chatbot, and then how to test its behavior using the builtin **Debug** tool.

#### [Build a simple chatbot](pingpong.md)
This guide walks you through how to create the simple chatbot introduced in the previous guide.

#### [Reuse a full-stack module](use-hours.md)
Importing a module is another way to reuse existing work on OpenCUI. Modules are reusable conversational components based on their service interface. They are considered full stack when they are paired with a compatible provider. In this guide, we will show you how to add functionality to your chatbot by reusing a full-stack module.

#### [Build a full-stack module](build-service.md)
This guide show you how to develop the module and provider we introduced in previous guide.

#### [Deploy a chatbot](quickstart-channel.md)
Using Messenger as example, this guide shows you how to configure chatbot and channel so that they point to each other. After going through this, your chatbot will be available in Messenger. 

#### [OpenCUI workflow](opencui-flow.md)
We use a Git-like version control system to make it easy for builder to collaborate on the structured definition of the chatbot.

For the impatient, [you can get started now](https://build.opencui.io).
