  - title: CUI for your APIs
    details: Building valuable services is hard, and we can not help with that. But if you already have APIs, building conversational user interface for it should be easy, with OpenCUI.

  - title: Separation of Concerns
    details: Decompose chatbot building into multiple concerns like service, interaction and language perception, so different aspects can be handled by different people.

  - title: Component-Based
    details: Never build from scratch, build complex behavior by reusing black-box components, so you can focus on what you want instead of how to implement it.

  - title: Hot Fixable NLU 
    details: Accuracy is not the most important metric when it comes to dialog understanding. To deploy a chatbot into production, every thing need to be hot fixable by the operation team.

  - title: Open Source Runtime
    details: Reactjs enables teams to focus on their application dependent interaction logic, instead of reinventing wheels. OpenCUI is doing the same for chatbots.

  - title: Multi-language Ready
    details: The same interaction logic should be shared between all the different languages, so that you can use people with entirely different skillsets for this.
