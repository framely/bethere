# Chatwoot

When a user demands talking to a human agent, we can forward the conversation to the support system. Currently the open source system Chatwoot is the only support system.

### Set Up Routing Priority <Badge text="Framely" />

To make intent based routing work, you need to set up routing priority. When there are unfinished intents in the conversation, we follow routing priority to decide which team we should route the conversation to. If an unfinished intent is one of the associate intents in routing priority, we route the conversation to the corresponding team. Otherwise, we route the conversation to default team. Follow these steps to set up routing priority.

1. Click **Setting** > **Routing Priority** > **Default**, input team id of the default team.
2. Click **add** to add more teams. Input the name of intent in **Associate intent** box.

::: tip How to Get Team Id?
In Conversation field, click a team, and the last number in current url is the id of this team.
