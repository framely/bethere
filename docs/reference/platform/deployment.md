## Environments
 
Framely currently provides two separate serving environments, development and production. 

When building your chatbot on paltform and testing your chatbot in [Try It Now](testing.md), it means you are in the development environment, regardless of whether you merge your diffs to master or not.

If you are done with testing and keep all instances merged into master, once you deployed your chatbot, it means the latest version of your bot will be published to production environment. Then you can test the production version with integrated channel, see more informations about integration with channels click [Channel](../channels/overview.md).
