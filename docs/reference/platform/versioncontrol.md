# Version Control

This is how we manage and track changes to software code. A good example of version control is [git](https://git-scm.com/). Framely version control is modeled after git. Others can't see your branch, so you have to merge to master so that others can view the master version.  Version control helps members collaborate in building the chatbot.



**1**. Make sure that you have **committed** the changes on **EN** and then you should be back to **STRUCT**

**2**. *Click* on **version** on the **SideMenu**

**3**. *Click* on **+ Pull Request** and you should be able to see your commit:
> Pull request is used to indicate that you want to merge to master

**4**. *Click* on the item and drawer should slide in and click **Approve**
This is the review stage that can be done by your peers. For our case, we will just approve.

**5**. *Click* on merge when the next drawer slides in. This should pop a modal where you enter version tag and *click* 
**Save** . The changes are merged into master.
