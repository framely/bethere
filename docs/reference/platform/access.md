# Access Control

Collaboration is encouraged on the Framely platform. This is through you as an owner, inviting other people to be members of your organisation. You can also manage collaborators. We will discuss how to do that in a few steps:

> Note that some of the collaboration flow actions are based on our flexible [plans](/pricing).

When you add a member, you can perform  the following actions on them. This is how you as an owner can manage members.

- Set as owner

- Convert member to collaborator(Member now can longer access internal projects).

- Remove member

Collaborators can make changes and make **pull requests**. This will be **reviewed**, **approved** and **Merged**. The reviewer can also close the pull request. 
Changes made by member are not visible on the master branch until they make a pull request.
