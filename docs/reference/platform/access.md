# Access Control

[[toc]]

## Motivation

It is common for multiple members to collaborate on building a project. Framely offers access control, which lets you give more granular access to specific project resources and prevents unwanted access to other resources. 

Access control lets you adopt the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege), so control access and permissions granted to team members, you grant only the necessary access to your project resources.

## Organization Access

Your team can collaborate on Framely by using an organization account, which serves as a container for your shared work and gives the work a unique name and brand. You can invite people to join your organization, then give these members a variety of roles that grant different levels of access to the organization and its project. 

The roles in the organization are:
| Role   | Summary |
|:--     |:---     |
| Member | Can see all other members, can be granted access to projects. |
| Owner  | Full administrative rights to the org, and have complete access to all projects. |

Organizations can own public, internal and private project. You can start with Starter Plan, which includes limited features on public project. To get the full feature set on public project, internal and private project and additional features at the organization level, you can upgrade to Team or Case Based plan. For more information, see [Pricing](../../pricing/README.md).

## Project Access

In addition to managing access to the organization itself, you can separately manage access to your organization's projects. 

1. You can restrict who has access to a project by choosing a project's privacy: public, internal or private:

| Privacy  | Summary |
|:--       |:---     |
| Public   | Accessible to everyone in the Framely. Only have read-only permissions, if they are not granted specific access. |
| Internal | Accessible to certain organization internal members. Only have read-only permissions, if they are not granted specific access. |
| Private  | Only accessible to you and people you explicitly share access with |

2. You can give organization internal members and outside collaborators different levels of access to projects, including chatbots, components and providers owned by an organization by assigning them to roles. From least access to most access, the roles for a project are:

| Role 	| Summary |
|:--    |:---     |
| Read  | Accessible to view your project |
| Edit  | Accessible to edit language related content to your project |
| Write | Manage the project without access to sensitive or destructive actions |
| Admin | Full access to the project, including sensitive and destructive actions like managing privacy or deleting a repository |
