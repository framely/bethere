# Build a reservation module
In the previous guide on [build an hours module](../guide/build-module.md), we showed you how to declare a service and build a conversational user interface (CUI) in a module. In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to build CUI for a specific use case, table reservation in particular, on top of a predefined [generic reservation service](../reference/plugins/services/reservation/reservation-api.md).

The table reservation module assists users in booking, viewing, or canceling reservations in a restaurant setting. This guide will use "[making a reservation](./reservation-cui-design.md#make-a-reservation)" as an example to demonstrate the steps to conversationally expose a service in a module. Exposing viewing and canceling reservations should be similar, and you can check the [table reservation module](https://build.opencui.io/org/me.restaurant/agent/tableReservation/struct/type) to see how it is done.

## Before you start
1. [Sign up](./../guide/signingup.md#sign-up) for an account and log in to [OpenCUI](https://build.opencui.io/login).
2. If you're not yet familiar with the platform procedures, we recommend reading the [Quickstart guide](../guide/index.md) before proceeding.

## Create module: tableReservation
To create a module, fill out the project creation form with the following settings:
- **Project label**: Enter `tableReservation`.
- **Template**: Select **LibraryWithCore**. This template has already imported the necessary types from the `io.opencui.core` library.
- **Languages**: Add **English(en)**.
- **Enable service interface**: Turn this toggle off. You won't need to declare a new service for this module as you'll be reusing an existing one.

## Import the service
To use functions declared in the reservation APIs, you need to import that service first.
1. Enter the [reservation module](https://build.opencui.io/org/services.opencui/agent/reservation/struct/service_schema) where the service is declared and import it into the `tableReservation` module you just created.

## Prepare types for the service
It is common for APIs to be designed to be as generic as possible, so that the same backend can be used for different domains. Typically, these APIs are defined using abstract types which can then be customized into different concrete types for different domains. The Reservation API is designed based on this principle. In particular, it introduces an abstract type called 'Resource' which is used as return type for a function that return a list of candidate resources. This type represents things that can be booked ahead of time, which can map to concrete types such as hairdresser or table.

Booking resources is about pairing user with a resource that has particular properties. Therefore, each resource has some read-only properties, such as the capacity of a particular table, which should be set up in the backend by the operations team. During the booking process, the chatbot needs to find out the user's preferences on certain criteria, such as party size, so that it can provide the users with what they need.

### Build frame: Table
For restaurant business, the bookable resource is `Table` which represents a table in a restaurant. In addition to the existing properties defined in the [Resource](../reference/plugins/services/reservation/reservation-api.md#resource), each table resource should also have its property representing capacity â€“ the number of guests it can hold. Restaurant defines the number of tables they have as well as how many people can each table fit in the backend. 

#### Schema layer: declare a frame
At this layer, you will create a "Table" frame, implements **Resource** frame.

##### Create the frame
Inside the `tableReservation` module
1. Create a frame labeled `Table`.
2. Inside the `Table` frame, inherit `services.opencui.reservation.Resource`.

   ![inherit](/images/blog/tutorial-build-reservation/inherit.png)

##### Add slots
Next, add a slot of **kotlin.Int** type with the label `capacity`, representing the maximum number of guests that the table can seat.

#### Annotate type: Table
Since this type doesn't need to be exposed conversationally, there's no need to add dialog annotation.

## Build CUI for the service
On OpenCUI, skills are used to build CUI. Before creating a skill, determine which slots to add to it based on the reservation APIs and the CUI design.

### Build skill: MakeReservation
Based on the slots mentioned in the [make a reservation](./reservation-cui-design.md#make-a-reservation) function and [makeReservation](../reference/plugins/services/reservation/reservation-api.md#makereservation) and [listResource](../reference/plugins/services/reservation/reservation-api.md#listresource) functions, the following information is required.
- `userIdentifier`: A unique identifier for the user making the reservation.
- `location`: The specified place that owns resources. Here, it should be the location of your restaurant.
- `resourceType`: The type of the resource. Here, it should be "table".
- `duration`: The resource duration of the reservation. 
- `number`: The number of guests attending the reservation.
- `date`: The date of the reservation.
- `time`: The time of the reservation.

Here are some assumptions about this business:
1. There is only one location for this restaurant.
2. For table reservation, the type of resource should be "table".
3. There is only one duration among all the resources.
4. the number of guests determines which table the user can book (its capacity need to be greater than or equals to the party size). 


#### Schema layer: declare a skill 
Note that not all slots are designed for user input; some are designed to simplify specifying the interaction logic, such as resource type, duration, and location. This information may be implied or supplied by the backend, but including it in the context makes it easier to use the generic reservation APIs. Given these assumptions, the business can provide the location, resource type, and duration for the reservation process.

##### Create the skill
Inside the `tableReservation` module and **Types** page, under the **Structure** view.
1. Create a skill labeled as `MakeReservation`.

##### Add slots
To prompt a user for a specific day, use the [DatePicker](../reference/plugins/components/datepicker/README.md) frame. Ensure that the `components` module exists under the **Dependencies** tab before proceeding. If it does not, import the [components module](https://build.opencui.io/org/io.opencui/agent/components/struct/frame/63c8aea6517f06c1880e3cff) to the `tableReservation` module first. 

Inside the `MakeReservation` skill and **Schema** tab, under the **Structure** view.
1. In the **Slots** section, add the following slots:
   - `userIdentifier` of type **Frame / io.opencui.core.user.UserIdentifier**.
   - `location` of type **Entity / services.opencui.reservation.Location**.
   - `resourceType` of type **Entity / services.opencui.reservation.ResourceType**.
   - `duration` of type **Entity / kotlin.Int**.
   - `number` of type **Entity / kotlin.Int**.
   - `datePicker` of type **Frame / io.opencui.components.dataEntry.DatePicker**.
   -  `timePicker` of type **Frame / io.opencui.components.dataEntry.TimePicker**.
2. In the **Services** section, select **services.opencui.reservation.IReservation** with the label `reservation` to access functions, then click **Save**.

##### Define functions
To make it easy to use reservation APIs under table reservation use case, you can add some native helper functions. These functions bind the slots value to service function's input parameters, provide a simpler interface for the skill.

To support the contextual snippets in [Make a reservation](./reservation-cui-design.md#make-a-reservation) service, add these functions:
1. `filterTables(resourceList:List<Resource>):List<Resource>`
    - Filter the table resources based on the number of people based on the assumption mentioned above.
2. `isTableAvailable(date:LocalDate?, time: LocalTime?):Boolean`
    - Check if there is an available table based on the number of people and the input parameters. If an input parameter for date or time is null, the function will not use it as a filter when checking table availability.
3. `makeReservation():Boolean`
   - Select a table resource meets the user's requirement and call the **reservation.makeReservation** passing that resource along with other required information to make a reservation.

To define functions:

Inside the `MakeReservation` skill and **Schema** tab, under the **Structure** view. In the **Functions** section, add these functions
1. **filterTables**
   - Function label: `filterTables`
   - Input parameter
      - Type **Frame / services.opencui.reservation.Resource** with label `resourceList`, multi-valued, not null
   - Return type: **Frame / services.opencui.reservation.Resource**, multi-valued, not null
   - Implementation:
      ```kotlin
      // If the resourceList is empty, just return an empty list
      if(resourceList.isEmpty()) return emptyList()
   
      // Get a list of unique capacities in ascending order
      val capacityList = (reservation.listResource(location!!, resourceType!!, null, null, 0) as List<Table>).map{it -> it.capacity!!}.distinct().sorted()
   
      // Find the minimum capacity which is not smaller than the number of people
      var capacity:Int ?= null
      for(i in capacityList){
         if(i >= number!!){
            capacity = i
            break
         }
      }
   
      // Return an empty list if there is no suitable capacity
      if(capacity == null) return emptyList()
   
      // Filter the tables by the capacity
      val filteredResource = (resourceList as List<Table>).filter{
         it.capacity == capacity!!
      }
      return filteredResource
      ```

2. **isTableAvailable**
   - Function label: `isTableAvailable`
   - Input parameter
      - Type **Entity / java.time.LocalDate** with label `date`, nullable
      - Type **Entity / java.time.LocalTime** with label `time`, nullable
   - Return Type: **kotlin.Boolean**, not null
   - Implementation:
     ```kotlin
     return if (date == null){ 
        filterTables(reservation.listResource(location!!, resourceType!!, null, null, duration!!)).isNotEmpty()
      } else if (date != null && time == null){ 
        filterTables(reservation.listResource(location!!, resourceType!!, date, null, duration!!)).isNotEmpty()
      } else{ 
        filterTables(reservation.listResource(location!!, resourceType!!, date, time, duration!!)).isNotEmpty()
      }
     ```

3. **makeReservation**
   - Function label: `makeReservation`
   - Input parameter: N/A
   - Return Type: **kotlin.Boolean**, not null
   - Implementation:
     ```kotlin
     // Get available tables resource
     val availableResources = filterTables(reservation.listResource(location!!, resourceType!!, datePicker!!.date!!, timePicker!!.time!!, duration!!))
    
     // Make a reservation if there is an available table
     return if (availableResources.isNotEmpty()){
        reservation.makeReservation(userIdentifier!!.userId!!, datePicker!!.date!!, timePicker!!.time!!, duration!!, availableResources.first()) != null
     } else{
        false
     } 
     ```

#### Annotate type: MakeReservation

During the slot filling process, the following dialog annotations will be used.

1. [Fill strategy](../reference/annotations/fillstrategy.md): The fill strategy for each slot depends on who fills it. The slots filled by the business should have a direct fill strategy, while the slots filled by the user should follow the default always ask strategy. Here are the fill strategies for each slot:
    - Direct fill: `location` slot, `resourceType` slot and `duration` slot.
    - Always ask: `number` slot, `datePicker` slot and `timePicker` slot.
2. [Initialization](../reference/annotations/init.md): When the business fills a slot, you can use initialization to provide a value for that slot. Here are the initial values for each slot:
   - `location`: The first value in the list returned by [listLocation](../reference/plugins/services/reservation/reservation-api.md#listlocation).
   - `resourceType`: "table" with the right type.
   - `duration`: The first duration of the first value in the list returned by [listResource](../reference/plugins/services/reservation/reservation-api.md#listresource).

3. [Value check](../reference/annotations/valuecheck.md): When the user provides a slot value, you can use value check to validate it. For this guide, following the default recovery strategy is sufficient. Here are the rules for each slot to be considered valid:
   - `number`: There is at least one table that can seat the requested number of guests.
   - `datePicker`: There is at least one table available within the business's restrictions and the values (number and date) provided by the user.
   - `timePicker`: There is at least one table available within the business's restrictions and the values (number, date, and time) provided by the user.
   
4. [Confirmation](../reference/annotations/confirmation.md): Once the user has provided all required values, you can ask them to confirm their choices.

Now, add the following dialog annotations to the **MakeReservation** skill:

##### Add slot level annotations
1. **`location` slot:**
   - Fill strategy: Direct fill
   - Initialization with the following Association:
      ```kotlin
      reservation.listLocation().first()
      ```

2. **`resourceType` slot:**
   - Fill strategy: Direct fill
   - Initialization with the following Association:
      ```kotlin
      services.opencui.reservation.ResourceType("table")
      ```

3. **`duration` slot:**
   - Fill strategy: Direct fill
   - Initialization with the following Association:
      ```kotlin
      reservation.listResource(location!!, resourceType!!, null, null, 0).first()!!.durations!!.first()
      ```

4. **`number` slot:**
   - Fill strategy: Always ask
   - Value check with the following Condition:
     ```kotlin
     filterTables(reservation.listResource(location!!, resourceType!!, null, null, duration!!)).isNotEmpty()
     ```
   - Names: number of people
   - Prompt: How many people will you need the reservation for?
   - Value check template : 
     ```kotlin
     - There is no available table for `${number}` people, please choose another number.
     ```

5. **`datePicker` slot:**
   - Fill strategy: Always Ask
   - Value check with the following Condition:
     ```kotlin
     filterTables(reservation.listResource(location!!, resourceType!!, datePicker!!.date!!, null, duration!!)).isNotEmpty()
     ```
   - Names: date
   - Prompt: Which day will you be joining us on?
   - Value check template :
     ```kotlin
     There is no available table for `${number}` on `${datePicker!!.date!!.expression()}`, please choose another date.
     ```
  
6. **`timePicker` slot:**
   - Fill strategy: Always Ask
   - Value check with the following Condition:
     ```kotlin
     filterTables(reservation.listResource(location!!, resourceType!!, datePicker!!.date!!, timePicker!!.time!!, duration!!)).isNotEmpty()
     ```
   - Names: time
   - Prompt: What time would you like the reservation for?
   - Value check template :
     ```kotlin
     There is no available table for `${number}` at `${timePicker!!.time!!.expression()}` on `${datePicker!!.date!!.expression()}`, please choose another time.
     ```

##### Add type level annotations
- Confirmation with the following Condition:
  ```kotlin
  number != null && datePicker!!.date != null && timePicker!!.time != null 
  ```
- Confirmation template :
  ```kotlin
  Are you sure to book a table for `${number}` at `${timePicker!!.time!!.expression()}` on `${datePicker!!.date!!.expression()}`?
  ```
- Expressions
  - I want to book a table
  - I want to book a table `$datePicker$`
  - I want to book a table at `$timePicker$`
  - I want to book a table for `$number$`

::: warning Attention
Do **NOT** copy and paste the value wrapped by `$`, please type the value instead.
:::

#### Configure response
Once the user has provided all necessary information for a reservation, the chatbot should inform the user whether the reservation has been made successfully. To do this, you will define two branches and configure their respective responses.

##### Define branch: InformFailure
1. Turn on **Branches** and add a branch labeled `InformFailure`.
2. Inside the `InformFailure` branch, add a **Single Value Message** action. Configure this action as follows:
   - The condition of the branch:
     ```kotlin
     makeReservation() == false
     ```
   - Single Value Message:
     ```kotlin
     Sorry, the table you want to book is currently unavailable. You may change to another time or date, and try it again.
     ```

##### Default branch
In the **Default branch** section, add a **Single Value Message** action, and add this template:
```kotlin
Your reservation has been made! We'll see you at `${timePicker!!.time!!.expression()}` on `${datePicker!!.date!!.expression()}`. You can check your reservation under your ID: `${userIdentifier?.userId}`.
```

::tada:: Congratulations! You've built up a reservation module.
